# photonics-lab-app
App to fetch Pressure, Concentration and Related data from Server and show various information based on that data.

#Project Overview
A portable TDLAS(Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spetroscoy) device will measure the concentration and pressure of Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere in realtime and log the data into the server. This app will fetch those data from the server and it will show various information, graphs, charts etc based on that data.
The final objective of this project is to install a number of such portable devices at different key places of a city or region and observe the pollution level in realtime.

#Note
This app is not the final version. For experimental purposes a temoprary server is used to store the data, so the amount of data avilable may be very less.
